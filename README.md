# Lemonade

## Description

Welcome to Project: Lemonade app!

Project developed during the Android Basics in Kotlin course.

The goal was to create a simple, interactive mobile app that allows you to juice lemons until you have a glass of lemonade. 

The finished Lemonade app will consist of a single screen. 

When users first launch the app, they're greeted with a prompt to pick a lemon by tapping a picture of a lemon tree.
